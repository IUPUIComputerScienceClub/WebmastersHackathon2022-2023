1. Define class named BreadBox
    1a. Create constructor and take in the breadType, breadQuantity and the boolean, needBread on object creation
    1b. Define toggleNeedBread function
        1ba. Checks if needBread bool is set to false, if so, set to true
        1bb. Else, needBread is set to false since needBread must already be true

2. Create Breadbox object and instantiate with the accompanying variables
3. Alert user the current status of the needBread boolean
4. Call the toggleNeedBread function which will change the currently false needBread bool, to true
5. Alert user the current status of the needBread boolean
