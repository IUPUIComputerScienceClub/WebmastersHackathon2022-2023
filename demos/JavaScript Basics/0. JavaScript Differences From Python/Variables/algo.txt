1. Defined breadName_var with the value "Mike"
2. Defined breadName_let with the value "Wheat"
3. Defined breadName_const with the value of "Gluten-Free"

4. Redefine breadName_var in curly brackets to the value of "John"
5. Try to redefine breadName_let but instead create a local variable with the same name in curly brackets with the value set to "Taco"

6. Create function test
    6a. Define breadInFunction with the value of "breadFunc"

7. Alert user the current value of breadName_var (which is John since it was redefined inside of the curly brackets)
8. Alert user the current value of breadName_let (which is Wheat since it wasn't redefined inside of the curly brackets)
9. Alert user the current value of breadName_const (which is Gluten-Free)
    NOTE: Modification of this variable would throw an exception since const variable can't be modified
10. Alert user the current value of breadInFunction (which throws an exception since the variable can only be access the function it was defined in)
