1. Grab element "blue1" and listen for a click event. On click, call "setColor" function and pass the string "blue"
2. Grab element "green1" and listen for a click event. On click, call "setColor" function and pass the string "green"

3. function setColor
    3a. Sets html document background color to the received color

    1a. "()" creates a anonymous function, a function that has no name and mostly used for temporary things
    1b. Sets html document background color inside that anonymous function.
