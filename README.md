# IUPUI's Computer Science Club Presents: Webmasters Hackathon!
IUPUI's Computer Science Club is hosting a hackathon for students to practice and apply their programming skills. This event, titled "Webmasters", will focus on Web Development.

Please read through the rest of this document carefully - it will hopefully answer any questions you may have about the event. It will also help you to avoid any issues later. You can always ask questions if you have any.

**Who Can Participate?**

This event is open to everyone! This includes (but is not limited to) Freshman, Sophomores, Juniors, Seniors, Graduate students from any school at IUPUI. All entries will recieve a free T-shirt by showing up to either the event kickoff or one of the Q&A/work sessions scheduled to help participants.

## The Theme: Webmasters
This hackathon has been divided into two separate competitions: **Front-End** and **Full-Stack**.

## When is this taking place?
The event will take place on the second full week of February. You will have from Monday, February 13th to Sunday, February 19th at 11:59 pm to complete your project. While the competition can be done entirely online, if you need to ask questions it will be best to talk to a club officer in person during one of the times. (We will have food & drinks during the kickoff event, as well as a presentation to go over the event!)

* Monday, February 13th, 6-9 pm in SL247 & SL251 (Event Kickoff & Start)
* Wednesday, February 15th, 1-4 pm in SL247 & SL251
* Friday, February 17th, 1-4 pm in SL247 & SL251


### Front End Competition:
The **Front End** competition is focused on the html, css, and javascript that goes into creating a website. The Front End competition does not require a back end to make any of the front-end features work. However, you may come up with as many features as you like and set up the website as if it would have a backend. The goal is to design and implement a front end of a website you can be proud of.

Note:**You do NOT need to write a backend for the front-end competition. Focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**

### The Categories (Front End):
Below are the categories for winning the front end competition. Winners will be recognized on the [Computer Science Club's Website](http://csclub.cs.iupui.edu/). The Computer Science Club will also make an entry for the school news with the winners of each categories for each competition.

#### Documentation
Every solid project needs equally solid documentation in order for it to last. After leaving and coming back to a project, you may have asked yourself questions like "why does this variable have this name again?" and "what does this script do?". These are problems that will only grow if you do not properly document the purpose of each piece of code or script you write. Leave no room for guesses when you revisit your projects! This award will go to the project that has the best documentation for their work. Will we be able to read the documentation along with the code and understand its purpose?

#### User Experience (UX)
The experience of the user is one of the most important tasks a front end designer is tasked with. Yes, that's a very cool trick you did with the javascript, but how does it help you reach your goal? Every design implementation needs a reason to be useful. If not, it may end up causing more difficulty than good. On the other hand, too little thought put into how your user will experience the website may lead to people being confused and unable to use the website as intended. The award for this project will go to the project that manages to find a how to both make a website aesthetically pleasing while still being simple and intuitive.

#### Cleanest Implementation
The award for Cleanest Implementation will go to the project that manages to find a way to organize their code well. Did you name that variable 'x' instead of a useful name, like 'input_text'? If so, you may have some trouble later when you come back to this code! Clean Implementation means that the code manages to do what it needs to while still being human readable. Having intuitive code is an essential task when dealing with large scale projects that may have more than just you working on them. And this extends to more than just the code, naming conventions only scrape the surface! Does your file structure make it easier or harder to figure out what part goes where and how it works?  This award will go to the project that is designed to be clearly understood on top of accomplishing its tasks.

#### Honorable Mention
This is an extra category that we created in order to give to a project that we believe excelled but didn't quite fit neatly into one category. Maybe you did something we didn't expect and we don't know what to do - well you can still get recognized!

### Full Stack Competition:
Do you already have the skills for both front and back end? Then this is the competition for you! Create a website using any web stack and and web framework that you would like, from **Node.js** to **Django** whatever you can think of! From there, the rest is up to you! What kind of website do you want to create? Some ideas/technologies include:

* databases
* web games
* e-commerce site
* blog site
* event website
* APIs

These are just a few ideas to help get you motivated, so if there's something else you want to make, then go for it! This is your chance to put your skills to the test or learn some new ones. **But keep in mind that whatever you decide, you will need to finish in a week's time!**

This competition will require you to make not only the front end of a website but also the functional backend of the website. Compared to the Front End Competition where you can make a front end that doesn't necessarily perform the actual tasks, for this competition your website must perform the designed tasks that it was designed to handle.

### The Categories (Full Stack):
Below are the categories for winning the full stack competition. Winners will be recognized on the [Computer Science Club's Website](http://csclub.cs.iupui.edu/). The Computer Science Club will also make an entry for the school news with the winners of each categories for each competition. Most of the categories are the same as before, except for the extra category: **Data Structure/Data Organization**.

#### Data Structure/Data Organization
The award for Data Structure & Organization focuses on what data the website is trying to work with. Looking past all of the pretty lights and colors on the screen, a website is just a tool to move data around. How well you organize your approach to how you move this data around can make or break a website. Having a keen eye for not only where the project is now but where it could go is important to making sure your website will last. Depending on the goals of your project, you will need to have a plan for handling the data! This award will go to the project that demonstrates skill managing their data *in the context of their project* (It is easy to over do it for this. While you do want to think ahead, if you have your eyes too far ahead you may get tripped up on what's right in front of you. Keep that in mind - every project has a scope!).

#### Honorable Mention
This is an extra category that we created in order to give to a project that we believe excelled but didn't quite fit neatly into one category. Maybe you did something we didn't expect and we don't know what to do - well you can still get recognized!

## Rules
The rules for this event aren't a lot, but please stick to them:

**NO School-Inappropriate Content**
Please refrain from creating anything that would be considered inappropriate for an educational/school setting. Inappropriate submissions will be immediately disqualified from the event and reported to the school.
*If you have any concerns about your project, please speak with a club officer. 

**NO Plagiarism**
This is your chance to learn something new and apply it, not rip off someone else's work. While it is acceptable to learn how to do something when you don't already know, copying and pasting code or copying entire projects is not what this event is about. This also means that you are to refrain from simply taking a previous project and submitting it or modifying it for this event. We want to see what you can do in the time given.

## Examples for Beginners
We expect there to be some complete beginners for this competition, and that's perfectly okay! We have some examples for you created by our officers if you need them. Look through the hackathon directories for information on HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

*You are not required to use any of the examples given here or the web stacks used. If you already have web development experience and want to use what you know, then perfect.

## Submission Details
For this event, we will be having you submit your project using a Canvas. When you are finished with your project, you will be asked to upload the following to the canvas page:
* **Project Code** - All of the scripts/code you wrote to run the project.
* **Project Documentation** - All of the documentation you made for the project, as well as anything else you may wish to share - project workflows, diagrams, planning tools, etc.
* **your name (or your group name w/your members' names)**
* **your project's name** - if you a category, your project needs a cool name so it can be recognized!
* **A Video Presentation** - A video of you going over the project. Tell us what we need to know about the project. Your ability to present your work is important too! Communicating your work with others is an important skill that you cannot do without. Try to keep it short - only tell us what we need to know while going over what you think is important and notable about your project.

**The Canvas Course name is: Computer Science Club at IUPUI. Go to this google form and submit it so we can add you to the canvas page: https://forms.gle/q3jqJHYFbsWSzzKFA**

Projects can begin on Monday, February 13th, at 6:00 pm, and are due by 11:59 pm on Sunday, February 19th.

*Submissions will NOT be accepted past the deadline. Everyone has the same amount of time to work on their projects. Please ask if you have any questions. If you wish to submit after the deadline anyway, you can, but you will be inelligible for winning a category. If you are not finished and are worried about missing the deadline, submit what you have first then keep working.

## Other Details
We would like to keep a record of the projects that are submitted so we can promote the club later as well as keep track of club growth. We also believe there may be some learning opportunities from looking at where projects excelled or fell short. Of course, your project is yours and yours alone. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask the club officers.
